# Mergix

Mergix is a simple Python tool that enhances Git merge conflict resolution by providing a clear, categorized view of conflicts.

## Usage

```
python mergix.py
```
Mergix helps developers quickly understand and navigate merge conflicts, streamlining the resolution process.

## How it works

1. Runs `git status` to detect merge conflicts
2. Categorizes conflicts (e.g., content conflicts, rename conflicts)
3. Displays a formatted summary of all conflicts
